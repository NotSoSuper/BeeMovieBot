  "a pinch on that one.\n",
  "See that? It's a little bit of magic.\n",
  "That's amazing. Why do we do that?\n",

  "But I don't recall going to bed.\n",
  "Well, I'm sure this\n",
  "is very disconcerting.\n",
  "This is a bit of a surprise to me.\n",
  "I mean, you're a bee!\n",
  "I am. And I'm not supposed\n",
  "to be doing this,\n",
  "but they were all trying to kill me.\n",
  "And if it wasn't for you...\n",
  "I had to thank you.\n",
  "It's just how I was raised.\n",
  "That was a little weird.\n",
  "- I'm talking with a bee.\n",
  "- Yeah.\n",
  "I'm talking to a bee.\n",
  "And the bee is talking to me!\n",

  "Why would I marry a watermelon?\"\n",
  "Is that a bee joke?\n",
  "That's the kind of stuff we do.\n",
  "Yeah, different.\n",
  "So, what are you gonna do, Barry?\n",
  "About work? I don't know.\n",
  "I want to do my part for the hive,\n",
  "but I can't do it the way they want.\n",
  "I know how you feel.\n",
  "- You do?\n",
  "- Sure.\n",
  "My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or\n",
  "a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.\n",
  "- Really?\n",
  "- My only interest is flowers.\n",
  "Our new queen was just elected\n",
  "with that same campaign slogan.\n",
  "Anyway, if you look...\n",
  "There's my hive right there. See it?\n",
  "You're in Sheep Meadow!\n",
  "Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!\n",
  "No way! I know that area.\n",
  "I lost a toe ring there once.\n",
  "- Why do girls put rings on their toes?\n",
  "- Why not?\n",
  "- It's like putting a hat on your knee.\n",
  "- Maybe I'll try that.\n",
  "- You all right, ma'am?\n",
  "- Oh, yeah. Fine.\n",
  "Just having two cups of coffee!\n",
  "Anyway, this has been great.\n",
  "Thanks for the coffee.\n",
  "Yeah, it's no trouble.\n",
  "Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,\n",
  "I'd be up the rest of my life.\n",
  "Are you...?\n",
  "Oan I take a piece of this with me?\n",
  "Sure! Here, have a crumb.\n",
  "- Thanks!\n",
  "- Yeah.\n",
  "All right. Well, then...\n",
  "I guess I'll see you around.\n",
  "Or not.\n",
  "OK, Barry.\n",
  "And thank you\n",
  "so much again... for before.\n",
  "Oh, that? That was nothing.\n",
  "Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...\n",
  "This can't possibly work.\n",
  "He's all set to go.\n",
  "We may as well try it.\n",
  "OK, Dave, pull the chute.\n",
  "- Sounds amazing.\n",
  "- It was amazing!\n",
  "It was the scariest,\n",
  "happiest moment of my life.\n",
  "Humans! I can't believe\n",
  "you were with humans!\n",
  "Giant, scary humans!\n",
  "What were they like?\n",
  "Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.\n",
  "They eat crazy giant things.\n",
  "They drive crazy.\n",
  "- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?\n",
  "- Some of them. But some of them don't.\n",
  "- How'd you get back?\n",

  "- Barry Benson.\n",

  "They've done enough damage.\n",
  "But isn't he your only hope?\n",
  "Technically, a bee\n",

  "More than we realized.\n",
